<h1 align="center" class="style3">DiamondTouch Mouse Installation</h1>
<p align="center" class="style2">Copyright 2008 Circle Twelve Inc. All rights reserved.</p>
<p class="style3">The DiamondTouch Mouse utility is installed by default when the DiamondTouch SDK installer is run. This page describes how to install DTMouse.exe if the DT SDK installer was not run. In any case, DTCalibrate should be run before DTMouse, to calibrate the table to the projected image. If the system Display resolution is changed, then re-run DTCalibrate, and restart DTMouse. </p>
<p class="style3">1&gt; Install the DiamondTouch device drivers, as described in the documentation that comes with the DiamondTouch SDK. Adjust the noise levels and the projector image calibration     as needed. Touches will not be calibrated to the projected image until <strong>DTCalibrate.exe</strong> is run. It is recommended to project the computer screen image inside the table (i.e. under-project) enough so that there is a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) border between the edge of the projected image and the edge of the touch table on all four sides. </p>
<p class="style3">2&gt; Register the DiamondTouch ActiveX control. (This is also described in the DiamondTouch SDK documentation.)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style4">cd &lt;DiamondTouch SDK install directory&gt;\bin</p>
  <p class="style4">regsvr32 .\DiamondTouchEx.ocx</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style3">3&gt; Install the 


 &quot;Microsoft .NET Framework version 2.0 &quot; (or later Windows Update. If it has not already been installed, this update can be installed by doing a regular Windows Update and selecting it. Note that this is  a non-critical Windows update.</p>
<p class="style3">4&gt; Copy the DiamondTouch Mouse directory (DTMouse) to the computer with the DiamondTouch table and execute DTMouse.exe. </p>
<p class="style3">To make DTMouse.exe execute every time the computer starts up, put a shortcut to DTMouse.exe in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup (or similar). </p>
